## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The MSRV for *3.3* and newer releases of this crate is Rust **1.65**.

The MSRV for *3.0* to *3.2* releases of this crate is Rust **1.57**.

The MSRV for *2.x* releases of this crate is Rust 1.45.

Since the 3.0.0 release, this crate maintains a policy of supporting
Rust releases going back at least 6 months. Changes that break compatibility with Rust releases
older than 6 months will no longer be considered SemVer breaking changes and will not result in a
new major version number for this crate. MSRV changes will coincide with minor version updates
and will not happen in patch releases.
